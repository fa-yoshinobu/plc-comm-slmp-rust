## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- Release: Bumped crate metadata to `1.0.1`.
- Samples: Examples now require `SLMP_PLC_PROFILE`; they no longer default to `melsec:iq-r` when the PLC profile environment variable is omitted.
- Tooling: `slmp_bench_client` now requires `--plc-profile`; it no longer defaults to `melsec:iq-r`.

### Removed
- Samples: Removed the legacy `SLMP_PLC_FAMILY` and `SLMP_plc_profile` environment-variable aliases from the examples. Use the exact canonical `SLMP_PLC_PROFILE` name instead.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Release: Bumped crate metadata, lockfile metadata, and the `slmp-node` workspace crate to `1.0.0` for the first stable release line.

### Fixed
- Library: Reject `remote_run` clear modes outside `0`, `1`, and `2` before building the SLMP request payload.
- Library: Validate named-target `network`, `station`, `module_io`, and `multidrop` fields before narrowing to `u8` or `u16`, preventing silent wraparound for out-of-range values.
